# Stellar SDK Federation Server<br>
Simple Stellar Federation server running on Node.js & Mongo DB

## Getting started<br>
You need to have MongoDB installed on the machine you want to host the federation lookup server

### Running the server
1. Start by cloning this repo `git clone`
2. Run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies
3. Start the server with `node server.js` or `pm2 start server.js` (if you are using PM2)
-------------
Thats it, it starts up on port `9008` by default. This can easily be changed in the `server.js` file
